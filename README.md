# The Story

Humanity is on the brink of extinction. After a mysterious event, dogs have taken control of the planet. They are intelligent, organized, and dominate the cities, forests, and even the underground tunnels. Only a few humans have survived – and you are one of them. Your goal is to escape from the metropolis occupied by dogs and find freedom beyond the borders. The path leads you through dark urban canyons, deep sewer systems, and hidden passages – but the dangerous dog population is everywhere.
